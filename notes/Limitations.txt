execute_string does not have access to variables within the instance that called it.
All variables used in a string executed by execute_string can be considered local.  However, variables can be
passed into an execution using execute_string_args.
For example, if your code string looks like this:
	
	show_debug_message(x);

Then execute_string will not read x as your x position, but as a local variable named x.  You can pass your x
position into the string using execute_string_args, like so:

	execute_string_args("show_debug_message(x);","x",x);

----------

You can retrieve variable values after execution, but only if your evaluator still exists.
The evaluator will automatically destroy itself after it finishes executing, but you can prevent this by
calling wait_for_destruction() in code.  Then you may retrieve values and destroy it normally.
	
So, we can retrieve variables like this:

	var eval = execute_string("x = 20; wait_for_destruction();");
	x = eval_get_variable(eval, "x");
	eval_destroy(eval);
